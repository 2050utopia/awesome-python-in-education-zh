# Contributing to Awesome Python in Education

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know what and how to work on something. If you get stuck at any point you can [create a ticket](https://github.com/quobit/awesome-python-in-education/issues/new).

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the contributors managing and developing this resource. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## What kinds of contributions are expected

Improving the list by adding/removing, reorganizing/reordering, labeling/reviewing open resources are all examples of helpful contributions. When in doubt you can always [open a ticket](https://github.com/quobit/awesome-python-in-education/issues/new) or comment existing ones (like [#1](https://github.com/quobit/awesome-python-in-education/issues/1)).

## Ground Rules

* Content and code should use a free license.
* Proposed resources must follow Python (3.X) at least in the code examples.
* Resources that use legacy Python (2.X) are openly discouraged. If you find any in the list, you can request their removal. 
* Proposed resources should be usable (mainly) *by* teachers *for* students (secondary, vocational education and training -*VET*- and post-secondary levels) as well as *self-learners*.
